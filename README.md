**Material Ocean** is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) dark theme that combines
navy blue undertones with pastel highlights for a pleasant visual experience on both
mobile and desktop. The recommended accent colours for this theme are either `#ff475a`
(the default) or `#82aaff` (sky blue) and the fonts used in the theme's screenshots are
[Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) and [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode).

This theme is also available for [Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Equinusocio.vsc-material-theme), [Notion](https://notion-enhancer.github.io), and [a variety of other apps and desktop environments](https://github.com/material-ocean/Material-Ocean).

## Features

As well as recolouring Obsidian's interface,
the **Material Ocean** theme comes with a number of layout and typography
tweaks and quality of life editor improvements.

- Element spacing, sizing and positioning has been adjusted for a more
  consistent editing experience.
- **The window minimise/maximise/close button icons are replaced**
  by icons from the [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/) icons toolkit, matching
  the smoother and more rounded designs of the other in-app icons
- **The top-left sidebar toggle button has been accented** and the surrounding
  borders simplified and rounded for a more aesthetic design.
- **Long code lines overflow and are scrolled horizontally** instead of being wrapped
  onto the next line. In reading mode, whole code blocks can be scrolled. In source
  mode, individual lines must be scrolled due to architectural limitations.
- **Images are (slightly) rounded, headings are underlined** and callout arrows
  are right-aligned.
- **Checkboxes are circular** and completed tasks are greyed out instead
  of crossed out. The following alternative checkbox styles have been added:
  - **`- [/]` represents an incomplete task** with a half-filled circle.
  - **`- [-]` represents a cancelled task** by crossing it out.
